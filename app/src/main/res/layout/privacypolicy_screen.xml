This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from the Spogoo Mobile Application (the “App”) or www.spogoo.com (the “Site”).   Personal information we collect  When you visit the App/Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the App/Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site/App, and information about how you interact with the Site/App. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.   We collect Device Information using the following technologies:  - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.  - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site/App, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.  - “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site/App.  - Data Tracking Via Google Analytics   Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site/App, we collect certain information from you, including your name, Email Id, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including credit card numbers, Wallets, Debit Card Information etc), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order Information”.   When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.   How do we use your personal information?  We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site/App (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:  - Communicate with you;  - Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and  - When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.  - Retargeting advertisements via multiple channels.   We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site/App (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site/App, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).   Sharing your personal Information  We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above. For example, we use Shopify to power our online store--you can read more about how Shopify uses your Personal Information here: https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy. We also use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site/App -- you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.   Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.   Behavioural advertising  As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications we believe may be of interest to you. For more information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work.   You can opt out of targeted advertising by using the links below:  - Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads  - Google: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous  - Bing: https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/personalized-ads.
 Additionally, you can opt out of some of these services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out portal at: http://optout.aboutads.info/.   Do not track  Please note that we do not alter our Site’s/App’s data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.    Data retention  When you place an order through the Site/App, we will maintain your Order Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.   Changes  We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

              Returns and Refund Policy
We have a 7-day return policy, which means you have 7 days after receiving your item to request a return.   To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase. In case of defect or damage, we would also require a video proof of the product while unboxing to confirm your request of return.   To start a return, you can contact us at returns@spogoo.com. If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as well as instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.  
Damages and issues  Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.
 
Exceptions / non-returnable items  Certain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods (such as protein powders, vitamins, consumable food items etc.), and personal care goods.
 Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift cards.
Exchanges  The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.
Refunds  We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.
